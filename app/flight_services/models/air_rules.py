# No need for a separate AirRulesResponse model if it's just List[RouteFareRulesModel]
# However, if you want to wrap it with metadata, you could define:
# class AirRulesResponse(BaseModel):
#     traceId: str
#     rules_by_route: List[RouteFareRulesModel]
# For now, we'll assume the endpoint directly returns List[RouteFareRulesModel]
